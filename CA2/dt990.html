                          <br>
                          <p>Beyerdynamic has been a classic in the audio industry. 
                              From its roots in WW2, the company continues to deliver impact until today. 
                              Although the Beyerdynamic DT-990 is not new, its continued usage in many studios proved its worth in the market. 
                              Today, I’ll be putting the legend under scrutiny to find out what made the DT-990s the name we know today.</p>
                          <p>I own this pair since last year and I have been itching to make a review on it. 
                              I got it used online and it was in a good condition, albeit the pads being worn out. 
                              The DT-990 is my second open-back headphones after the Alessandro MS-1. 
                              This headphone is a different beast from the MS-1 and it makes a more compelling to buy this even though you might have another pair of open-backs.</p>
                          <h3>Build:</h3>
                          <p>Let’s describe the build characteristics in general. 
                              It is touted to be a studio monitor and it is. 
                              The DT-990 is made from hard plastic which is scratch resistant, has yokes made of metal and replicable headband. 
                              It can be thrown around a lot and still be able to keep itself together. 
                              There is no doubt about its usability in a studio with its tough construction. 
                              The DT-990 also has a permanently attached coiled cable. 
                              SOME people like me can understand and appreciate a permanently attached coiled cable whilst others may find it amusing and laugh at its lack of reliability.
                              May I say at how well the cable has endured stretching, tugging and general use over the years especially after going through one owner.</p>
                          <p>I am rather clumsy in taking care of headphones, so I wouldn’t say my pair is handled properly. 
                              However, it survives and functions like it was fresh out of the box. 
                              A testament to its build quality as expected from Beyerdynamic.</p>

                          <br>
                          <p>For sound, I am going to divide it up in three categories, Bass, Mids and Highs.</p>
                          <h3>Bass:</h3>
                          <p>The way this headphone performed for this section surprises me. 
                              An open-back shouldn’t have this amount of bass. 
                              The bass is punchy and tight. 
                              It has a lot of energy but it doesn’t over-excite over the other frequencies. 
                              However, it gives the DT-990 a lot of boom from the low end for tracks that don’t require much bass.
                              Tracks with acoustics may sound like they were trap in a room. 
                              In music that generally have electronic elements, it performs well and is suited for it. 
                              Fast-paced music also is paired with the DT-990 regularly throughout my listening sessions.</p>
                          <h3>Mids:</h3>
                          <p>The DT-990 is a bit shy with the mids. 
                              It is a little recessed as this headphone tends to lean towards the highs and bass. 
                              I describe as a shallow U. Drums do have enough energy to heard but like I said it takes a backseat. 
                              The mids are not a strong point for this headphone. 
                              That said, the mids quality is great because you are still able to enjoy vocals and guitars without any problems. </p>
                          <h3>Highs:</h3>
                          <p>I wonder why many owners like to point its tendencies to be sibilant. 
                              I do not find that appearing anytime during my listening sessions. 
                              Its highs is luscious and it makes cymbal crashes that much more satisfying. 
                              The DT-990 is able to conduct its spatiality with its highs. It just makes it a bit airier and more breathable in the sound itself. 
                              I enjoy its spatial cues in songs where that’s apparent. </p>
                          <h3>Conclusion...</h3>
                          <p>In conclusion, the Beyerdynamic DT-990 is a good studio monitor that is able to live up to the legend. 
                              A well-priced pair of headphones that is suited for studio usage and a good introduction to Beyerdynamic sound and its open-backs. 
                              I would recommend this headphone to people who listen to electronics and rock. 
                              Ratings wise it is a 7/10 when compared to my experience in the headphone world.</p>
