                          <p>What can you possibly do with $200? 
                              In my case, you get a Fostex T50rp. 
                              The audio world is filled with expensive tastes from headphones to DAC/AMPs to even cables. 
                              It wouldn’t hurt if you go on budget and buy the cheapest planar magnetic headphones. 
                              So, how does it compare to other headphones of its type or price range?</p>
                          <p>Fostex is a name well-heard in the audio game. 
                              Their parent company, Foster, make speaker components whilst its child makes headphones both boutique and practical. 
                              As a company in Japan, it is not alone. Competing with other regional brands, Fostex sticks out with their planar line and fancy design. 
                              You will not be disappointed when you buy a Fostex.</p>

                          <h3>Build:</h3>
                          <p>I will put it in one word. Tank. It can be stepped on, rolled, sit and kicked around like a football and stay intact. 
                              No, this does not compare to the Beyerdynamic DT-990s I reviewed.
                               The metal U-shaped yokes that slides up and down is sturdy and will not break off anytime soon. 
                               Plastic? Don’t worry, it is not flimsy or weak in any way. 
                               For this price range, I am more than happy to receive such a well-conceived product.</p>
                          <p>However, one gripe I have with the build is its pad of choice. It is abominable. 
                              Why did Fostex think that pads with the thickness less than a pancake would comfortable for human ears? 
                              I will never understand the thinking behind that and that’s why I replaced it with Shure 1540 pads. </p>

                          <p>Let’s move on to sound. As usual, I will divide into three categories, Bass, Mids and Highs.</p>
                          <h3>Bass:</h3>
                          <p>I feel that this is easily the headphone’s weakest point. 
                              Its not well extended and does not punch hard enough. 
                              If you’re listening to any bass heavy songs, this headphone will not perform. 
                              To me, the bass is just adequate for me to enjoy acoustics and some orchestral music. 
                              There is not much to say about it.</p>
                          <h3>Mids:</h3>
                          <p>Drums and guitar do shine with this headphone. 
                              I like it a lot. In fact, I pitied that this headphone does not have enough or else I could fully enjoy my hard rock collection. 
                              Mids are more apparent than the low end and they have a certain body to it. 
                              Drums sound full and I felt like there is a real drumset in the room, which also shows the amazing soundstage it has. 
                              An overall excellent experience in the mid-range.</p>
                          <h3>Highs:</h3>
                          <p>If you think that is all, you are wrong. Highs are clear as daylight and gives tracks more detail in the higher frequencies. 
                              Although there is some sibilance, I do not notice it and it does not ruin my experience. 
                              My music usually requires that sweet transparency as I want to hear my instruments, like cymbals and piano, with full confidence. 
                              I expected it to a bit harsher but this is not the case.</p>
                          <h3>Conclusion...</h3>
                          <p>In conclusion, I feel that this headphone performed well for the price range and is a good introductory to world of planar magnetic headphones. 
                              Some disappointment in the low end but the mids and highs more than make up for it. 
                              So, for ratings, I give it a nice 6 out of 10.</p>
