                          <h3>How did I get it?</h3>
                          <p>
                             A friend of mine offered me a good price.
                             <br>I decided to go at the deal and bought it.
                             <br>It really is a good starting headphone at a cheap price.
                          </p>
                          <p>And that's how I got it.</p>
                          <br>

                          <h3>Why did I get it?</h3>
                          <p> I was looking for a planar magnetic headphone.
                              <br>A planar magnetic headphone has a different driver design, therefore, different sound.
                              <br> It has a very wide soundstage and the bass is deep and extends very far.
                              <br> Though I should say, this headphones fits a lot of genres not just one.
                          </p>
                          <p>And that's why I got it.</p>
