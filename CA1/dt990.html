                          <h3>How did I got it?</h3>
                          <p>I was looking through retail prices for this headphone.
                             <br>I realised it was better to look though Carousell - a place where people sell and buy stuff online.
                             It is much cheaper to buy used.</p>
                             <p>And that's how I got it.</p>

                          <h3>Why did I got it?</h3>
                          <p>I wanted an open pair of headphones that fit best with anything I was listening to.
                             At the time, I had a large catalogue of Electronic music.
                             <br>Bam! This pair came at the right time and it was perfect for the genre.
                             Bass is its strong point together with a wide sound.
                          <p>And that's why I got it.</p>
